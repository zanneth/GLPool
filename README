GLPool
===================

This is a homework assignment I completed in college for a computer graphics
course. It's supposed to simulate a pool of water resting on top of a picture
at the bottom of the pool.

Controls
-------------------
d = start new wave
A/a = increase/decrease amplitude
V/v = increase/decrease wave velocity
r = reset everything

Compiling
-------------------
This project requires GLEW (OpenGL Extension Wrangler) in order to compile. If
you have homebrew installed on your Mac system, run `brew install glew` before
compiling.

Running
-------------------
You must have a graphics card that is capable of compiling and running shaders
using a driver that supports GLSL 1.1 or greater.
